# Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System
</br>
<h1>üñ• Existing System</h1></br>
The secret key is the fundamental key to gets approval. How programmers are a lot of fruitful in secret phrase breaking because of the frail secret key by the client. To reinforce the secret key stockpiling, the proposed framework utilizes the Honey word procedure alongside Honey encryption. Honeywords are false passwords which are put away as unique secret word to draw the aggressor. The basic idea behind Honeyword is the insertion of false passwords. These are to lure the attack. To generate the Honeyword of the original password, different techniques, like Chaffing- with-tweaking, Chaffing-with- password model, etc. are available, but on the existing approach .

<h1> ‚ùå Disadvantages of Existing System: </h1>
<li>Shoulder Surfing </br>
<li>Storage Requirements </br>
<li>Longer Authentication Time </br>
<li>Limited Security Against Automated Attacks</br>
</br>
<h1>üìÇ Proposed system: </h1>
A secure password authentication scheme is proposed which gives more security. This method uses a combination of pattern, key, and dummy digits. For this, the client needs to perceive and enlist design as area numbers from the network, register key qualities that guide esteem to secret password, and attach faker qualities to misguide the attacker. From that point forward to logging in, the client needs to review the example and guide the secret key from design with enrolled key qualities, making a secret word by including sham digits. It minimizes shoulder surfing, brute-force attacks, cross site scripting etc. due to the high complexity of guessing passwords in multi-levels: first from the pattern, then from key, and then from dummy values.

<h1>üåêSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:</h1>
The data flow diagram (DFD) is one of the most important modeling tools. It is used to model the system components. These components are the system process, the data used by the process, an external entity that interacts with the system and the information flows in the system.

<h1>‚öôÔ∏èSYSTEM TESTING :</h1>
The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product. It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring that the software system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of tests. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.
