# Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System

<h1>üñ• Existing System</h1></br>
The secret key is the fundamental key to gets approval. How programmers are a lot of fruitful in secret phrase breaking because of the frail secret key by the client. To reinforce the secret key stockpiling, the proposed framework utilizes the Honey word procedure alongside Honey encryption. Honeywords are false passwords which are put away as unique secret word to draw the aggressor. The basic idea behind Honeyword is the insertion of false passwords. These are to lure the attack. To generate the Honeyword of the original password, different techniques, like Chaffing- with-tweaking, Chaffing-with- password model, etc. are available, but on the existing approach .

<h1>üìÇ Proposed system: </h1>
A secure password authentication scheme is proposed which gives more security. This method uses a combination of pattern, key, and dummy digits. For this, the client needs to perceive and enlist design as area numbers from the network, register key qualities that guide esteem to secret password, and attach faker qualities to misguide the attacker. From that point forward to logging in, the client needs to review the example and guide the secret key from design with enrolled key qualities, making a secret word by including sham digits. It minimizes shoulder surfing, brute-force attacks, cross site scripting etc. due to the high complexity of guessing passwords in multi-levels: first from the pattern, then from key, and then from dummy values.
