# Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System
</br>
<h1>üñ• Existing System</h1></br>
The secret key is the fundamental key to gets approval. How programmers are a lot of fruitful in secret phrase breaking because of the frail secret key by the client. To reinforce the secret key stockpiling, the proposed framework utilizes the Honey word procedure alongside Honey encryption. Honeywords are false passwords which are put away as unique secret word to draw the aggressor. The basic idea behind Honeyword is the insertion of false passwords. These are to lure the attack. To generate the Honeyword of the original password, different techniques, like Chaffing- with-tweaking, Chaffing-with- password model, etc. are available, but on the existing approach .

<h1> ‚ùå Disadvantages of Existing System: </h1>
<li>Shoulder Surfing </br>
<li>Storage Requirements </br>
<li>Longer Authentication Time </br>
<li>Limited Security Against Automated Attacks</br>
</br>
<h1>üìÇ Proposed system: </h1>
A secure password authentication scheme is proposed which gives more security. This method uses a combination of pattern, key, and dummy digits. For this, the client needs to perceive and enlist design as area numbers from the network, register key qualities that guide esteem to secret password, and attach faker qualities to misguide the attacker. From that point forward to logging in, the client needs to review the example and guide the secret key from design with enrolled key qualities, making a secret word by including sham digits. It minimizes shoulder surfing, brute-force attacks, cross site scripting etc. due to the high complexity of guessing passwords in multi-levels: first from the pattern, then from key, and then from dummy values.

<h1>üåêSYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:</h1>
The data flow diagram (DFD) is one of the most important modeling tools. It is used to model the system components. These components are the system process, the data used by the process, an external entity that interacts with the system and the information flows in the system.

<h1>‚öôÔ∏èSYSTEM TESTING :</h1>
The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product. It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring that the software system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of tests. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.

<h3>TYPES OF TESTS:</h3>
<li> <code>Unit testing</code>
<li> <code>Integration testing</code>
<li> <code>Functional test</code>
<li> <code>System Test</code>
<li> <code>White Box Testing</code>
<li> <code>Black Box Testing</code>

 </br> </br>
In above screen DJANGO server started and now open browser and enter URL and press enter key to get below page.
</br>
<h3> 2.User Interface</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/User%20Interface.jpg?raw=true" />
 </br> </br>
 In above screen click on ‚ÄòNew User Signup‚Äô link to add new user details.
 </br>
<h3> 3.New User Login</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/New%20User%20Login.jpg?raw=true" />
 </br> </br>
 In above screen user is entering signup details and in place of password browsing and uploading image and then enter remaining details.
  </br>
  <h3> 4.User Credentials</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/User%20Credentials.jpg?raw=true" />
 </br> </br>
 In above screen after entering all details click on ‚ÄòRegister‚Äô button to get below page with image.
   </br>
 <h3> 5.User Spot Selection </h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src=https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/User%20Spot%20Selection.jpg?raw=true"" />
</br>
In above image user has to click on any part of the region then location will be added to text fields and first field will display the current location of mouse so you will know which point your mouse is at and u need to select 4 spot and then will get below screen.
  </br>
<h3>6.User Spot Submission</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/User%20Spot%20Submission.jpg?raw=true" />
  </br></br>
  In above screen I selected 4 spots and all those X and Y selected values are filled in the text fields and then press button to get below page.
  </br>
<h3>7.Admin Login </h3>

  </br></br>
  In above screen admin is login and after login will get below page.
   </br>
<h3>8.View Registered User Details</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/View%20Registered%20User%20Details.jpg?raw=true" />
 </br></br>
 In above screen admin can see all users details such as username and password as image and selected 4 spots and now logout and login as user suresh. 
   </br>
   CONCLUSION
  <h3> 9.User Login Successful</h3>
<img width="800" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mohan7745/Web-Based-Graphical-Password-Authentication-System/blob/main/User%20Login%20Successful.jpg?raw=true" />
 </br></br>
 In above screen in red colour text we can see login is successful and if u give wrong details then authentication will get failed and if you want to reset password with new image and spots selection then click on ‚ÄòRest Password‚Äô link and repeat same steps.   </br></br>
<Strong>NOTE:</Strong> In any field if values are available then just delete those values from the field so new selected spot values can be appear.

<h1>üìñCONCLUSION:</h1>
In conclusion, the proposed secure password authentication scheme using a combination of pattern, key attributes, and dummy digits represents a significant advancement in the realm of authentication security for modern web applications. By integrating these elements, the scheme addresses several critical vulnerabilities inherent in traditional password-based systems.Firstly, the use of a graphical pattern as the primary identifier enhances security by introducing a visual and intuitive authentication method. This not only makes the authentication process more user-friendly but also reduces the risk of shoulder surfing attacks, where passwords can be observed or recorded.Secondly, the registration of key attributes within the pattern adds complexity and uniqueness to each user's authentication credentials. This multi-level approach makes it significantly more challenging for attackers to guess or crack passwords through brute-force methods.
